Questions to discuss: 
1. How to reshape pictures? 
	1. InceptionV3 pre-trained Model requires to have pictures the square shape 299Ã—299.	
	2. ResNet (ResNet18) requires the size 224x224 (at least)

2. Can we train 2 NN models that dedicated to certain images sizes and later on build an ensemble?

3. We can use pre-trained model to get info of type of an animal, i.e dog, cat. Should it be a feature? 

4. We got outliers in target value. What should we do with it?
